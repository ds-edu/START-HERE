# Welcome!
---

This organization is a dedicated resource to sharing data science pedagogical resources for undergraduates/K-12 courses across the nation.

## Reminders

This is a public organization, which means that a majority of the resources we would like to share with each other are **public repositories**. Please be mindful before posting your homeworks, problem sets, and tests to ensure that you don't accidentally release solutions.

## Maintenance

This repository is maintained by the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley.
